# full-stack-open-blog-list

Repo for exercises from Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration
of Full Stack open course.

The exercises build, upon each other, a blog list application. The app allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog we will save the author, title, URL, and amount of likes from users of the application.
